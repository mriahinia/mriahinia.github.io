<p>Since October 2024, I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.ens.psl.eu/">École Normale Supérieure</a>, hosted by <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/david.pointcheval/index.php">David Pointcheval</a>.</p>
I completed my PhD at <a href="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/">École Normale Supérieure de Lyon</a> in France under the supervision of <a href="https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/alain.passelegue/">Alain Passelègue</a>. I got my master's degree in computer science from the same university, and completed my bachelore's in computer science at Sharif University of Technology in Iran.  </p>
<p>My current research is focused on designing secure advanced cryptographic protocols.</p>
    <p>I try to promote events dedicated to recognizing and empowering women in computer science and mathematics. I am willing to collaborate on organizing such events.</p>
